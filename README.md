# RPH Simple Functions for Developers
This repository contains a few functions from the <a href="https://ragepluginhook.net/Downloads.aspx?Category=1">Rage Plugin Hook SDK</a> and is made for new developers.<br>
In some functions I also used the LSPDFR API in order to have some examples ready for it as well. I'll upload more functions soon.
